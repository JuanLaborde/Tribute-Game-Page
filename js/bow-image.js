        "A zombie refers to most humans that have succumbed to the t-Virus (either through contaminated water supply or infected bites and scratches from a virus carrier).\n\nThe researchers at the Umbrella Corporation called them zombies in reference to the Haitian Folklore zombies, which are said to be recently dead bodies reanimated by necromancers for use as slave labor.\n\nSince some of the traits of zombies are the decomposed skin and the lack of pulse, they are often mistaken for reanimated corpses.",
        "The Cerberus code: MA-39 was an early attempt at creating a controllable Bio Organic Weapon by Umbrella, in a project led by the Arklay Laboratory.\n\nThey should not be confused with zombie dogs, which encompasses all dog breeds infected with any t-Virus strain in the secondary form.\n\nPronounced as the Greek word, Kerberos, this creature was named after the mythological guardian of Hades, a gigantic dog with three heads and a collar made of venomous snakes.",
        "Hunters are a group of human-animal hybrids which were genetically-engineered as biological weapons. Hunter species were created through the grafting of reptilian donor DNA to a fertilized human embryo with the aid of the t-Virus as a bonding agent, with the exception of the Hunter gama, which reversed the process with human DNA grafted into the genome of fertilized amphibian spawn.\n\nThe Hunters were one of Umbrella's more successful products and among their oldest, having entered production with the Hunter α in the 1980s.\n\nFollowing Umbrella's demise, other bio-weapon manufacturers used the research data to create new Hunter species, with the Farfarello being among the latest iterations.",
        "Lurkers were a species of frog created in the early years of t-Virus research as part of a study in the effects of mutation on amphibians and their suitability as bio-weapons.\n\nCreated by Dr. James Marcus, the failures in the Lurker indicated that amphibian-based bio-weapons were impractical with the t-Virus strains available at the time.\n\nThe only other known prototype amphibian bio-weapons were the Hunter γ over fifteen years later and the Albinoids, both of which suffered the same flaws.\n\n Mutants of a similar appearance to the Lurker were later spotted in the sewers during the Raccoon City Destruction Incident.",
        "The Black Tiger was a spider that had undergone excessive mutation, increasing its size three to six times that of normal Web Spinners due to prolonged infection of the t-Virus.\n\nAlso, unlike the ironically named Web Spinner, it was actually capable of producing a web.\n\nDue to the Web Spinners' unpredictable nature, B.O.W. research on the specimens was suspended, and the subjects supposedly destroyed.\n\nThis specimen had an unusual reaction to the virus, becoming a larger and more-deadly version.",
        "The Queen Leech was a mutant leech created through experimentation on annelids with the t-Virus.\n\nCreated as part of Dr. James Marcus' ongoing leech study, it was his final creation before his death.\n\nIn the time after, it consumed his hippocampus and gained his memories.\n\nBelieving itself subsequently to be Marcus reborn, it sought revenge for his death.",
        "Umbrella Corporation, manufactured in the Arklay Laboratory sometime before May 1998.\n\nUmbrella began using their newly developed t-Virus strains on animals soon after their founding.\n\nHowever, they were met with problems with their practicality, such as a lack of intelligence or insufficient strength increases which eliminated the Web Spinner as a reliable weapon.\n\nIn its place, the Chimera project was started, which intended to graft insect DNA into human embryos.\n\nHomeless women were abducted by Umbrella agents and forcibly impregnated with the modified embryos.\n\nOut of various insect-human hybrids that were envisioned as bioweapons, it was a fly-human hybrid that was chosen for continued study. It was subsequently cloned to produce identical bioweapons.",
        "Lisa Trevor was an American superhuman, and the first person to become a Progenitor adapter since at least the Neolithic.\n\n Trevor was abducted as part of a retroviral research project by what would later become Umbrella Pharmaceuticals.\n\nHaving survived and mutated from exposure to a Progenitor strain, Lisa's enhanced abilities made her a regular and reliable test-subject in bioweapons research.\n\nHer usefulness to the company ended in 1988 after twenty years of testing, when a Progenitor strain dubbed Golgotha Virus was isolated in her blood.\n\nLisa's powerful regenerative abilities allowed to her to survive her planned execution, and she would go on to live in the Arklay Mountains until 1998, when she involved herself in the Mansion Incident. She ultimately died when the facility was destroyed.",
        "The Neptune Project began early on in the Arklay Laboratory's research into animal bioweapons.\n\nAs their test subjects, they transported several adult great white sharks and infected them with the delta strain.\n\nThe research team was disappointed with the results, with little significant change.\n\nMuch of the research team moved on to other projects and most of the subjects were disposed of.\n\nA female was left for continued research when it was discovered she was pregnant.\n\nThe staff monitored her carry twelve pups, but ten died soon after hatching.\n\nThe remaining two survived and were subject to further study into the possibility of creating self-fertilizing B.O.W.s as an alternative to cloning, but chose against cloning them.",
        "Mutant wasps were created in May 1998 after feeding on the pollen of Plant 42.\n\nDue to the accidental outbreak at the Arklay Laboratory, the staff were unable to control a mutant wasp nest, with at least one man succumbing to the poison.\n\nA wasp nest at a nearby abandoned hospital was also contaminated by suckling on the nectar of the Monster Plant, Dorothy.\n\nIn Raccoon City, wasp nests were infected by unknown means.\n\nOne nest was based within Raccoon University's ventilation tower, and was marked by Dr. Peter Jenkins as a source for V-Poison, a critical ingredient in creating Daylight.",
        "The Yawn was an experimental B.O.W. test subject created at the Arklay Laboratory.\n\nIt was nicknamed Yawn in reference to the way its mouth opens before attacking, which resembled a yawn.\n\nAdders lived around the Arklay Mountains, with a number residing in the trees in the Spencer Mansion's courtyard.\n\nOne of these snakes was taken inside as a research specimen and infected with an unidentified strain of t-Virus.\n\nThe Yawn grew to a considerable size and, hormonally unstable, became too aggressive to control.\n\nAs the Epsilon strain spread out across the laboratory personnel, they were no longer able to contain the snake and it went on a rampage and likely killed a number of researchers while making the entire mansion its territory.",
        "A Tyrant is a human bio-weapon created through either a primary t-Virus infection to create a weapon, or the cloning of such specimens, with the intent to be used as super soldiers on the battlefield.\n\nUmbrella pioneered research on human mutants from 1988 to 1998 in their Tyrant Project, named after the virus itself.\n\nTyrants are distinguished from the typical human mutant, Zombies, by possessing certain genes relating to intelligence.\n\nTyrants were intended to be the ultimate bio-weapon for military use due to this intelligence, ultimately, specimens and research outlived Umbrella itself.",
        "Lickers are an irregular mutant resulting from a rare secondary metamorphosis (V-ACT) of Zombies infected with an unnamed variant of the ε strain.\n\nThe exact causes and process of transformation into a licker is imprecise and often unpredictable but typically affects zombies who have consumed large quantities of biomass to sustain their metabolism.\n\nIn any case, the material conditions which may lead a singular zombie to become a licker can often cause multiple to evolve and form a colony.\n\nLickers are noted for their exposed and expanded brains, lack of skin and eyes, extreme sensitivity to sound, substantive and newly reformed muscle structure, large talons and eponymous barbed tongues, the latter of which are capable of piercing flesh.",
        "Alligators have been known to be infected with the t-Virus, and a number of individual cases exist.\n\nAn alligator lived in the sewers underneath Raccoon City.\n\nThis very large mutant grew from a baby which, like the urban legends, was flushed down the toilets, fulfilling the sewer gator myth.\n\nThis alligator became a threat to a band of survivors moving through the sewers in search of a way to the NEST.\n\nIt was killed when it bit into a fuel canister, and a well-targeted shot caused it to explode inside its mouth.\n\nSome abandoned and dissected alligator corpses can be found in the Incineration Disposal Plant P-12A's treatment room.",
        "T-00 was one of six within the T-103 series that were airlifted into the city, and was given instructions to recover a G-Virus sample from the pendant of Sherry Birkin and kill any surviving officers and civilians found in the Raccoon Police Station.\n\nT-00 was successful in entering the building, by this point most police officers had already mutated into Zombies, and T-00 encountered only a handful of survivors.\n\nOther accounts suggest T-00 was struck with a van, or even torn open by Dr. William Birkin, who had transformed himself into a disfigured monster with the G-Virus.\n\nWhat is known however is that T-00 abandoned the police station and began a search of NEST for Golgotha.\n\nThere, T-00 was injured, either by fire or by molten metal.\n\nThese extensive injuries triggered the de-activation of its Power Limiter, allowing it to mutate into its Super Tyrant form.\n\nT-00 fought RPD officer Leon S. Kennedy, but was ultimately killed when he fired a rocket at it from a M202 Flash.",
        "Dr. William Birkin was a virologist who worked for Umbrella Pharmaceuticals.\n\nOne of the leading scientists behind the t-Virus and discoverer of the Golgotha Virus of which he was head of the research project, he turned against the Umbrella Corporation after failing to achieve a promotion to its executive.\n\nThe company's attempts to prevent an unauthorised deal with the U.S. military served as a catalyst for the events of the Raccoon City Destruction Incident.\n\nIn the standoff, Birkin was gunned down with automatic fire after attempting to resist Alpha team, group send by Umbrella.\n\nAlpha Team retrieved a duralumin case containing t and G samples and left for the sewers to their extraction point.\n\nThe injured Birkin infected himself with a remaining G sample, but the virus didn't properly stabilize onto his body and the scientist himself was unable to become a G-human, and instead transformed into a large and powerful G mutant.",
        "The Hunter GAMA model of Hunter was developed by Umbrella Europe as part of a reinvestigation into amphibian-based B.O.W.s, which failed ten years earlier with Dr. Marcus' Lurker.\n\nIt was nicknamed the Frogger by its development team.\n\nThe Hunter γ was developed based on information retrieved from the American branch's Hunter α model.\n\nContrary to the American design method, the Hunter Gama involved human DNA being bonded with a fertilized amphibian egg with the t-Virus.\n\nThough this method worked, the resulting creatures had several flaws that made them impractical for battlefield use, such as a sensitivity to heat and their vulnerable mandibles being exposed when they attacked a target.",
        "The Drain Deimos, commonly abbreviated as D.D., are parasites which have been infected and mutated by the t-Virus.\n\nTheir only confirmed sighting was during the Raccoon City Destruction Incident, in which they were infected by feeding on blood from zombies.\n\nLike many other arthropods, the fleas responded to the virus by dramatically increasing in size, strength and aggression.\n\nAs is common with t-Virus creations, the Drain Deimos takes its name from mythology - in this case Deimos, the Greek personification of dread.",
        "Nemesis was developed by Paris Labs of Umbrella's European Branch as one of the Nemesis T-Types, an offshoot of the Tyrant Project.\n\nThe idea behind them was to create a B.O.W. that still had the power of a Tyrant, but more intelligent and able to follow orders.\n\nWhile the North American branch created T-A.L.O.S., a Tyrant cyborg controlled by the Red Queen computer.\n\nThe European branch developed the NE-T virus, a new virus created by the NE-alpha parasite.\n\nWhen placed in a compatible host, the parasite hijacked the body and brain function.\n\nThis in turn caused a violent mutation within the Tyrant Subject, which ended up disfiguring them.\n\nAs a side effect, the parasite allowed the host to retain their intelligence and the secretions from the parasite would further enhance the regenerative abilities of the Tyrant host.",
        "Ganado is the term given to a human victim of the Subordinate Plaga Species used by Los Iluminados.\n\nThe word is derived from the Spanish word ganado, which means livestock in general, but can refer to bovines in particular.\n\nGanados were only found in one particular region of Spain, and were part of a pagan religion.\n\nThese Ganados were slaughtered in a Crusade led by Salazar, who sealed the surviving Plagas in underground caves.\n\nThe Plagas escaped the caves in the early 21st century and turned a number of miners from the nearby village into Ganados.\n\nThrough genetic-engineering of the parasite, the bio-weapons developer Los Iluminados was able to produce a new species, the Dominant Plagas, which would be under the control of its host and mutate them at will. The Ganados were of this latter variety.",
        "The Garrador, which roughly translates as the clawer, were augmented human hosts of the Plaga, a parasitic organism native to Spain.\n\nTo restrict their indiscriminate killing power, their eyelids were stitched together and they were bound in cells.\n\nThe loss of eyesight led to increased hearing, making them dangerous even when blind.\n\nThe Garrador finds its prey by hearing, and will charge towards the origin of any loud noises in earshot, viciously swiping with its claws.",
        "Novistadores were large creatures that were originally human, encountered by Leon during his exploration of an isolated Spanish region.\n\nNovistadores were created from a horrific experimental application of the Plaga organism on the human body as part of Los Iluminados' research.\n\nLeon encountered two forms of Novistador in Salazar Castle; one in the sewers and underground, and another in the castle towers.",
        "The Iron Maidens were a species of human bio-weapon created by Los Iluminados.\n\nThey were derived from the earlier Regenerador species.\n\nTheir primary distinction is the needles that grow across their body, the result of BOW research into the Regenerador's viability as a weapon.\n\nIron Maidens were produced on a Spanish island controlled by Los Iluminados.\n\nThey were part of the wider research into the abilities of the Plaga parasites in human hosts and the viability of Plaga-based bio-weapons, of which Dr. Luis Sera was a major contributor for.\n\nAll known Iron Maidens are believed to have been killed during the 2004 abduction of the First Daughter, Ashley Graham, which led to US involvement in the region.",
        "El Gigante is the name of a group of human-based Bio Organic Weapons produced by Los Iluminados.\n\nThey stand four times taller than the average human and have increased strength and durability. However, their intelligence and thus their controllability was greatly reduced, resulting in their minimal production.\n\nEl Gigante were first produced from human test subjects during Los Iluminados experiments on the mutational effects of the Plagas on their hosts.\n\nThough they proved to be exceptional as bio-weapons, they became difficult to control and were a danger to Ganados.\n\nConsequently, Los Iluminados produced only a small number of El Gigante, spreading them around the region.\n\nTwo were sent to the Salazar Castle, where they guarded the underground.\n\nAnother two were sent to the village and stored within the coal mines the Ganados no longer had use for.",
        "Del Lago was a massive Plaga-infected amphibian that lived in a lake near a Spanish village.\n\nOne of the earlier Plaga experiments by Los Iluminados, Del Lago, was a salamander that became host to a parasite.\n\nThe organism reacted to its small host by mutating it, increasing its size considerably.\n\nIt was fed by the disposal of corpses, as seen by Leon S. Kennedy as a pair of Ganados dumped a police officer's corpse in the lake.",
        "The U-3, dubbed It by Osmund Saddler, was one of the experimental bio-weapons developed by Saddler's research team on the island.\n\nIt was a horrifying chimera of human, insect, and reptile DNA fused imperfectly into a single being, itself hosting a Plaga parasite.\n\nThe U-3 displays the biological features of each of its genetic-benefactors, though imperfections in the technology that created it led it to appear asymmetrical in shape.\n\nThe upper part of the body is that of a human torso, displaying a monstrously-warped face and marked by strange scars upon its nape and crown.\n\nIts spinal column is also human in origin.\n\nThe creature's right arm was clawed, while its left was a long tentacle which it used as a whip against enemies. Its four front and hind legs appeared bonded by a centipede-like fleshy piece of muscle.",
        "The Verdugos, Spanish for Executioner, were B.O.W.s created by Los Iluminados to serve as personal bodyguards or the right-hand men of Ramon Salazar.\n\nThe two Verdugos were created by a fusion of human and insect DNA, and were completely controlled by Plagas.\n\nTwo Verdugos, presumably the only two in existence, served as Ramon Salazar's bodyguards.\n\nThey concealed their mutated forms beneath voluminous, resplendent Los Iluminados cloaks, with one wearing red and the other wearing black.",
        "Majini is the term given to describe people who are suffering from disease caused by either the Type 2 or Type 3 Plagas.\n\nThe earliest known example of Majini occurred at some point after 2004, when Tricell developed their Type-2 Plaga species at a top-secret facility near Kijuju.\n\nIn 2008, the Type-3 Plaga underwent human testing in the tribal marshlands near Kijuju, resulting in the Ndipaya men becoming Majini, with the women and children dying from complications manifesting in painful seizures.\n\nBy the end of 2008, Tricell had implanted these Type-3 Plagas into a private security force it had hired to defend its laboratory, consisting largely of former soldiers from the country's recent civil war.\n\nAs part of a field test to directly observe the proficiency of Plagas in guerrilla warfare, Type-2 was sold to an Islamist terrorist group based in nearby Kijuju. As part of the first stage of the experiment, an initial ten people were turned into Majini, and with their Plagas already pregnant were soon able to begin implanting more parasites into other people.",
        "Cephalo is the name given to the middle stage of a Type 2 Plaga and Type 3 Plaga's life, analogous to the Spanish Plagas' Plaga B stage.\n\nIt gets its name from the Cephalopentandra, a root vegetable found in Kenya.\n\nCephalo itself is the Greek word meaning head.\n\nCephalos appears as long, centipede-like parasites with a spiked bone protruding from its spine, which can be used as a weapon.\n\nCephalo grows larger in size when their host Majini's head has been seriously damaged or destroyed, breaking through the neck to defend the rest of the host body.\n\nAt this point they take complete control of the body's function, acting as a replacement brain.\n\nUnlike the Spanish Plaga, they were based on Type 2 Plaga forms such as Cephalo are more resistant to sunlight and may be encountered outside at daytime.",
        "The Kipepeo was a form of Type 2 Plagas created by TRICELL to market the sales of B.O.W.s to bioterrorists, with their flight capabilities being of interest.\n\nSome majini hosting Kipepeo were killed in front of Chris Redfield and Sheva Alomar, as the parasites broke out of their host's bodies.",
        "Popokarimu was a genetically modified bat-based B.O.W. produced by TRICELL created by infecting bats with the Las Plagas parasite.\n\nThe Popokarimu was a prototype BOW originally intended to be sold as part of weapons deal to an unknown party in Africa by arms dealer Ricardo Irving.\n\nAfter finding out from a Tricell spy planted in the BSAA that the organization was onto the deal, Irving moved the deal location to the mines near Kijuju and arranged to have the Uroboros Test Subject left at the original deal location to ambush any BSAA agents that showed up.",
        "The result of Ricardo Irving injecting himself with the Dominant Strain Plaga.\n\nRicardo underwent a massive level of mutation with huge tentacles sprouting from his back.\n\nFurther mutations occur when Ricardo slips into the water transforming into a giant aqua-creature; a 30 foot leviathan with armoured scales for skin.\n\nThe human remains of Ricardo can be seen when the B.O.W opens its mouth.\n\nDespite this show of power and new found aquatic ability, the B.S.A.A are able to subdue the beast after firing a salvo of explosive rockets from a boat’s turret.\n\nRapid fire guns are also used which severs the length of tissue connecting the remains of Irving to the rest of the creature.\n\nThis causes Irving to spiral out and collapse on the desk of the ship whilst the bulk of the monster sinks beneath the surface.",
        "Uroboros is an RNA virus in the Progenitor family.\n\nEngineered by Dr. Albert Wesker as the ultimate eugenics tool.\n\nThere is currently no known vaccine.\n\nThe virus' name is derived from the Ouroboros in Greek mythology, a snake or snake-like creature which consumed itself.\n\nWork began on the Uroboros Project sometime in 2006, following an encounter Dr. Albert Wesker had with Dr. Oswell E. Spencer, Earl Spencer, who revealed to him Umbrella Pharmaceuticals' secret eugenics goal in creating a race of Übermensch to advance human society, with Wesker himself being part of such a project.\n\nHaving begun to question the emerging War on Terror, he concluded that humanity itself was the problem, and the only way to bring about a utopian society of the Übermensch was to use the Progenitor Virus against the very planet itself, which would kill all but those with certain genetic characteristics.\n\nSuch people would theoretically be enhanced physically and mentally.",
        "Having learnt of Wesker's need for medicine, he was confronted during launch preparation for the stealth bomber and given an overdose of PG67A/W.\n\nWeakened but still dangerous, Wesker was able to take off from the tanker and fought the two BSAA agents on board the bomber.\n\nWhen the rear hatch opened up, he was pulled out and, though he made an attempt to take Alomar with him, a gunshot wound sent him falling to the ground.\n\nAs the stealth bomber was falling to the ground, he was able to survive the fall towards a volcano.\n\nWith the Uroboros Project ruined, Wesker destroyed one of the missiles so as to infect himself with the virus.\n\nThe fight across the volcano was put to a close when a BSAA helicopter picked up Redfield and Alomar, who were able to use RPG-7s to create an explosion that incinerated him after he fell into the lava.",
        "J'avo are a class of mutant humans created from the injection of C-Virus into the bloodstream.\n\nUnlike the Zombies, created by inhaling fumes loaded with C-Virus, J'avo maintains their intelligence.\n\nThe name, J'avo, and the names of their various mutations are derived from Serbian words as decided by the BSAA European branch's R&D department.\n\nIn Serbian, the word đavo means devil.\n\nUnlike earlier strains such as the one which infected Bindi Bergara during Neo Umbrella's testing, the strain of C-Virus which saw widespread in the 2012 and 2013 terror attacks robbed the infected of their free will and made them intensely loyal to Carla Radames.\n\nAnother modified strain may have been used for J'avo soldiers of Neo-Umbrella, who have been observed to mutate at will rather than as an automatic response to injury.",
        "Meset is a human-bird hybrid created through the effects of the C-Virus.\n\nIts name is derived from the Serbian word, which means moon.\n\nLike many other human mutants, Mesec were byproducts of Dr. Carla Radames' C-Virus research, which sought to turn humans into B.O.W.s rather than through the traditional cloning methods.\n\nA number of experimental viral strains were created to splice the DNA of select animals into human test subjects' genomes.\n\nWhen the strain that turned humans into Mesec proved useful as a bioweapon, it was mass-produced and distributed to the Edonian Liberation Army.",
        "The Bloodshot is the result of a C-Virus Zombie mutating in response to excessive damage, similar to the V-ACT process. They were encountered by Leon, Helena, and Ada during the Tall Oaks incident. They were first encountered at the Tall Oaks gun store.\n\nFollowing their use as B.O.W.s by Neo-Umbrella, the black market trade organization known as Umbrella Co. had acquired C-Virus bio-weapons through unknown circumstances.\n\nThey were likely sold on the black market from this point onward.\n\nThey would also be deployed to the Antarctic Base for Umbrella Co. mercenary training and anti-B.O.W. weapons testing.",
        "The Napad is a Complete Mutation created by C-Virus-infected corpses being fused together.\n\nThe Napad is named after the Serbian word for assault.\n\nThey are encountered by Chris Redfield and Piers Nivans while in Edonia City Hall.\n\nThey also encounter them in the Oil Rig where Sherry Birkin and Jake Muller are being held.\n\nAda Wong encounters them in the Tall Oaks Cathedral lab area where they hatch from Chrysalids.\n\nThese same Crysalids are encountered by Leon Scott Kennedy and Helena Harper earlier but do not hatch.",
        "Lepotica is a Complete Mutation used as a B.O.W. intended to disperse an airborne form of the C-Virus around its immediate area, transforming interloped individuals into zombies.\n\nIts name comes from the Serbian word Lepotica, which is used to describe feminine beauty.\n\nThese creatures were created by Derek C. Simmons and his researchers as a Complete Mutation birthed from a Chrysalid.\n\nIn 2012, Nanan Yoshihara was the first known Lepotica to come into existence, and it was the result of Carla's experimentation with the strain as given to Nanan's close friend, Bindi Bergara, to revive her from death.\n\nNanan was the cause of the Marhawa School Incident.\n\nSeveral Lepotica is notable for being responsible for the outbreak of zombies in Tall Oaks.",
        "Rasklapanje is a victim of the C-Virus, although one that is extremely mutated.\n\nRasklapanje is derived from the Serbian word for dismantle.\n\nThis dangerous leech-like B.O.W. was encountered by Ada Wong in Lanshiang during the bioterror incident, wandering in an abandoned aircraft carrier.\n\nThe same ones were later encountered by Chris and Piers.\n\nAnother was fought by Leon and Helena in the city's back alleys.\n\nIt is also encountered by Jake Muller and Sherry Birkin in the underwater facility where they were imprisoned.\n\nIts Serbian name means dismantle which is a play on its ability to detach its body parts.",
        "Strelac is a form of mutant humans brought on by C-Virus infection.\n\nPart of a category of mutations dubbed Complete Mutations, Strelac are formed when J'avo undergo a process comparable to Virus Activation, where the C-Virus forces in further mutations.\n\nStrelac emerges from cocoons with entirely new bodies unrecognizable as human.\n\nTheir name is the Serbo-Croatian word for shooter while Strela means Arrow.",
        "Ubistvo was the result of a Complete C-Virus mutation encountered by Ada Wong in Lanshiang, followed by Jake Muller and Sherry Birkin.\n\nIts name is derived from the Serbian word for murder.\n\nNeo Umbrella's research into the Ubistvo concluded that, because of its destructive personality, its introduction into the battlefield should only be done in special situations.",
        "The Ogroman was a series of B.O.W derivated from the C-Virus.\n\nThe series name stems from ogroman, a Serbian word synonymous with enormous and gigantic.\n\nThe first known deployment of the Ogroman was on Christmas Eve, 2012, when the Edonian Liberation Army was losing its fight with the newly arrived Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance.\n\nDespite Carla Radames' warnings of a flaw in the Ogroman's design, the ELA's commanding officer had no time to wait for the correction to be made and sent it out against the BSAA.",
        "Brzak was a human-based B.O.W. created by the C-Virus.\n\nIt was encountered by Leon and Helena within the depths of the ancient catacombs that lied under the Tall Oaks Church.\n\nIt's name is derived from the Serbian word for Rapids.\n\nBrzak was created by The Family as part of their research into the C-Virus.\n\nIt was later used by the staff at the Tall Oaks Catacombs facility as a waste processor, consuming computer equipment as an elaborate means of destroying incriminating data.\n\nThe staff also considered dumping corpses into the water, though Brzak was noted for a lack of interest in corpses; in both cases, the object had to be pushed around to give the impression of being alive.",
        "The Iluzija was a human-based B.O.W. encountered by Chris Redfield, Piers Nivans and several other BSAA operators while dealing with the bioterror in Lanshiang, China, primarily in the Poisawan slums in Wai-yip.\n\nIts name is derived from the Serbian word for illusion.\n\nThe Iluzija was unleashed in Lanshiang during the bioterrorist attack by Neo-Umbrella, killing numerous BSAA forces.\n\nThe creature attacked Alpha Team and dragged off one of its members, forcing the remaining members, led by Chris Redfield, to give chase.\n\nThey pursued the beast to an apartment complex, where it began picking off the soldiers one by one, which greatly angered Chris who became determined to exterminate the B.O.W.",
        "Ustanak was a human-based B.O.W., based on a former employee of Dr. Carla Radames, and was instrumental in Neo Umbrella's hunt for Jake Muller for the creation of the Enhanced C-Virus. Ustanak's name comes from the Serbian word for revolution.\n\nThe individual that became the Ustanak was infected with the C-Virus on June 22, 2011, which he was rather pleased with.\n\nThe unnamed individual's own writing stated that he had been born with an incredible frail body and had no qualms about losing his humanity if he gained power.\n\nA report filed five days later defined the mutant's survival after the first 24 hours as substantial progress, considering the deaths of the earlier 322 candidates.\n\nAt some point during the first few days, the individual was involved in a laboratory accident, leading to the loss of its right arm.\n\nDespite the C-Virus' notability for mutating J'avo endlessly, his arm failed to regenerate - an evident flaw.\n\nRegardless, his abilities in other fields led the Neo-Umbrella scientists to consider the experiment a success.",
        "Succumbing to his infection as the enhanced C-Virus consumed his body, his entire structure began to split and fracture until his body ultimately mutated into a horrific monstrosity resembling a quadruped.\n\nSimmons proceeded to battle both agents aboard the speeding train, believing himself to have the upper hand with his new mutation.\n\nHowever, the two managed to eventually wear him down until he reached a point of vulnerability, particularly under the realization that The Family intended to leave him to die and simply replace him.\n\nHe attacked in a final attempt to kill Leon and Helena, but a single well-placed shot from Agent Harper caused him to lose his balance and fall under the train.\n\nThe two abandoned the derailed train cars, leaping into the nearby ocean as they believed Simmons to be finished.",
        "The HAOS project was Carla Radames' and Neo Umbrella's ultimate bio-weapon and was so important to Carla's plans that it required an entire underwater facility to support the creature once its creation was complete.\n\nCarla's plan was to unleash HAOS to spread the C-Virus across the entire world, where it would agamogenesis and disperse the virus in a gaseous form in a method comparable to the Lepotica, only with a higher concentration of the virus.\n\nNeo-Umbrella planned to release Haos once it had fully developed but a contingency plan -Plan D- was devised in case Carla was killed before the B.O.W was complete.\n\nThe creature would be released regardless of whether it was fully developed, with the intention that it could spread the virus across the globe before its imperfections took effect.",
        "Mold is a genus of fungus which is believed to have originated in an Eastern European mountain range.\n\nThough its interactions with humans has taken place over centuries, it was first subject to scientific study in the early 20th century.\n\nSamples of Mold were obtained by The Connections in the 1990s as a potential source of bioweapons research, the result of which were human B.O.W.s capable of mind control.\n\nAs many as six species of Mold are known to exist, separated between the naturally-occurring Mold native to Europe and the A-Type through E-Type genetically-modified species developed by The Connections.",
        "The Molded crawler is another, much smaller variant of Molded.\n\nThis variant of the creature bears the same biologically mutated body composition as the more common humanoid Molded, with the exception of its ability to move on all four limbs which are distinguishably longer and slimmer, and having a much leaner and smaller body.\n\nThis makes the creature exceptionally nimble.\n\nUnlike the normal Molded, it lacks endurance and it can be killed more easily. This however does not mean it's any less of a threat as it can cover distances with its excellent agility, leaping at its victims and moving about in an unnatural manner.\n\nIt is unable to use its gaping jaw as means of offense.",
        "The lycan are a mutant human species whom are noted for their canine-like characteristics resulting from an outbreak of Mold in Eastern Europe and the infestation of the Cadou parasite.\n\nFrom 1919 to 2021 they had carved out their territory in an isolated mountain village, where they preyed upon other humans.\n\nLycan are believed extinct following the region's destruction by the Fungal Root.\n\nLycan are the result of a human being implanted with Cadou, a parasitic nematode genetically modified by the Mold.\n\nOriginally these people were failed test-subjects for a superhuman project intent on finding a suitable host body for the copied Eva consciousness, with Lycan being the result of the host and parasite rejecting one another due to the host's low affinity.",
        "Moroaica are a variety of human mutant that arose in a mountainous region of Eastern Europe.\n\nMold-infected victims of serial killer Alcina Dimitrescu and her daughters, they were restored to life but suffer mental degradation.\n\nThe Moroaice were named after the Moroi, a vampiric creature in Romanian folklore, with the name Moroaica indicating female Moroi.\n\nMoroaică are identifiably human, having once been human women who died during tortuous blood-draining procedures.\n\nNotes found in the dungeons they now populate indicate Alcina may have been trying to create more daughters, though they all turned out to be failures.\n\nInfected with the Mold, they were revived as hollow husks of their former selves, lacking the intelligence they once possessed when they were mortal, and now seek only to feed on those around them.",
        "The Haulers are mutant humans resulting from Mold infected corpses and mechanical modifications.\n\nThey act as guards and workers of Heisenberg's Factory.\n\nHaulers are similar to Moroaicǎ but appear exclusively male and were mechanically modified by Karl Heisenberg.\n\nTheir craniums are attached with a headgear in order to stabilize their neural activity similar to Soldaten.\n\nHaulers are all armed with an axe made from scrapped metals.\n\nAccording to his notes, Heisenberg originally created the Hauler's without the cranial implants but these specimens were completely brain dead and only moved by destructive instinct.\n\nThe current Haulers appear to be the 1.01 versions of the Soldaten mentioned in his notes.",
        "The Samcă is a type of human mutant that arose in a mountainous region of Eastern Europe.\n\nIt is a Mold-infected victim of serial killer Alcina Dimitrescu who was restored to life while suffering mental degradation and physical mutation into a feral, bat-like creature.\n\nIt is named after a folkloric monster said to afflict pregnant women and young children with disease.\n\nThe exact relationship between Samce and Moroaice is uncertain, but the former appears to be a further mutation of the latter, given their similar appearances and traits.\n\nWhile often obscured by the hood of its ragged garment, the face of a Samcă is greatly deformed, resulting in poor if any sight.\n\nIts tongue has grown into a long, pointed appendage used for drinking blood, similar to the proboscis of a mosquito.",
        "The Baby was a highly grotesque creature resembling a deformed fetus, encountered by Ethan Winters in House Beneviento while experiencing hallucinations caused by Donna Beneviento and her fungus-infected plants.\n\nThe Baby is a large creature resembling a hideous distortion of a human fetus.\n\nIt has swollen black eyes, a gaping, toothless mouth and a slimy red body with slightly underdeveloped limbs.\n\nIts waist appears to be twisted around, leaving its legs pushing backwards as it crawls forward on its hands; the result gives it a vaguely grasshopper-like profile.\n\nIts stomach has a large flap of loose flesh that trails behind it like a short, limp tail, leaving bloody streaks in its wake.",
        "Uriaș was a powerful troll-esque Lycan who served as an enforcer for Mother Miranda.\n\nOriginally the chief of an East European mountain community, he was infected with the Cadou parasite and transformed into a monster, along with most of the other villagers.\n\nUriaș Străjer is his older brother.\n\nUnlike the other Lycans, Uriaș' size and strength increased dramatically upon infection.\n\nThis allowed him to wield a large war-hammer, jump incredible distances, and toss columns with ease.\n\nDespite his size, he possessed superhuman agility, although he wasn't quite as fast as normal Lycans.",
        "The Uriaș Străjer is the older, stronger brother of Uriaș, both pre and post Lycan transformation.\n\nHe is released from the Mold beneath the Village to battle Chris Redfield from reaching the Black God and hindering Miranda's plans; however, he is killed by the veteran BSAA operator with fire support from John Lobo Perlman.\n\nLike his younger brother, Uriaș Străjer is a human who was converted into a feral beast-man by a Cadou implanted in his body, becoming significantly larger and stronger than a regular Lycan.\n\nHe is unnaturally large and muscular, with a wild mane of grey hair around his face.\n\nHis mutation is more severe than Uriaș, with several tendrils protruding from a large growth on his back.\n\nHe also has armor-like protrusions on his shoulders and face, with the latter resembling a wolf mask.",
        "Vârcolac is a variety of genetically-modified chimeric mammal which lived around a isolated mountain village in Eastern Europe.\n\nThe Vârcolac body is a mix of recognizably human and wolf traits.\n\nLike canines, they walk in a quadrupedal gait, though their limbs are human in shape and proportion, with hind legs that are awkwardly balanced and require them to tread on their heels, and knees that brush close to the ground.\n\nBoth their hands and feet are identifiably human, though their fingers are more elongated and claw-like.\n\nTheir skull is a blend of human and wolf, resembling a human with an unusually large jaw consisting of sharp teeth used for tearing flesh.\n\nTheir body is coated in thick hair, typically grey, which covers their spine, scalp and beard prominently.\n\nThe Vârcolac is effectively canine in intelligence, demonstrating no higher brain function and relying entirely on its physical strength rather than weapons.",
        "Sturm was created in the same manner as its fellow Soldats, being a human augmented with extensive cybernetics and powered by a Cadou parasite.\n\nIts most notable feature is the massive turboprop engine mounted on its torso, with three chainsaw blades that essentially turn it into a lethal walking rotary fan.\n\nUnlike most Soldats, its reactor exhaust was located on its back instead of the front.\n\nDespite its top-heavy design and lack of arms (the latter apparently being due to it sticking them into its own propeller), Sturm seems to have no difficulty walking and running around. Heisenberg's notes describe it as having very low intelligence, although it still seems cognizant enough to recognize his voice and obey his commands.",
        "Countess Alcina Dimitrescu , commonly referred to as Lady Dimitrescu, was a mutant human aristocrat.\n\nFrom the 1950s until her death in 2021, Dimitrescu maintained a pseudo-feudal rule over the peasantry near Castle Dimitrescu as one of the Four Lords of the region.\n\nFor more than sixty years, Dimitrescu was feared by the locals over allegations of mass murder and cannibalism, which were later found to be true.\n\nShe was killed by Ethan Winters in February 2021, after conspiring with Mother Miranda in the abduction of his daughter Rose.",
        "Lord Karl Heisenberg was a human mutant who lived in an Eastern European mountain range.\n\nA genius in engineering, he is presumably the patriarch of the Heisenberg family.\n\nHe runs the inherited Heisenberg Factory, located just outside the village, and serves Mother Miranda, along with the other three major houses in the mountain range.",
        "Salvatore Moreau was a mutant human who lived in an Eastern European mountain range.\n\nPresumably the last surviving member of the Moreau family.\n\nThe Cadou transformed him into a hideous fish-like monster with gills, a swim bladder, webbed hands and feet, a hunched back, and a deformed face.\n\nHis out of control cell growth also led to large parts of his reservoir being coated in thick, gooey enzymes.\n\nHe appears to exhibit some control over these enzymes, attempting to trap Ethan by engorging them into walls.\n\nMost notably, he demonstrates the ability to mutate into an enormous fish-like monster with a gaping maw and eyes across the length of his spinal region.\n\nWhile in this form, he has the ability to expel extremely potent acid from his stomach in large enough quantities and with sufficient force to produce an artificial acid rain throughout the entire valley when directed upwards.",
        "Miranda was an Eastern European biologist and cult leader who ruled over an isolated mountain village from 1919 to 2021.\n\nAfter losing her only daughter to the Spanish flu, she discovered and became infected by the Mold within a nearby cave.\n\nGaining vast knowledge and superhuman powers from the infection, she pioneered research on this mysterious fungus and used it to conduct experiments on local villagers over the next century, hoping to find the perfect vessel to revive her daughter.\n\nIn February 2021, she abducted the infant Rosemary Winters for this purpose and, seeing no further use for the villagers, committed a genocide by unleashing Lycans on the local populace.\n\nMiranda was ultimately killed by Rose's father, Ethan Winters, who had become intertwined with a BSAA operation to contain the outbreak.",
